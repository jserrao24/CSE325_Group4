# Overview

The main goal of this hotel system is to manage hotels and its rooms reservations.
The customers or clients will be able to browse hotels and reserve their desired rooms.
The Manager will be able to controll and add all others in the system as well as its rooms and assign the employees for each hotel.
The Employee will be able to manage the reservations making sure that the same room is not booked twice, accept reservations or delete reservations, and add info to the rooms specifications.

# Scope

We will include the full experience of search and book an hotel room reservation. We will add the value to the finished booked room but we will not include the payment method.
The users will be assigned with different roles, and a database will be created to gather information from the whole system. When a room is booked it will notify the employee so that he can accept or reject the reservation.
We will not add the confirmation by email feature in the project.
